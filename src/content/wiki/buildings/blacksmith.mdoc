The {% building /%} is a 3x3 crafter and can make any vanilla tools, armor, swords, and shields (no bows or redstone items). The {% building /%} will work when they receive a request for any of those items from another worker. 

> **Note:** You will need to teach the {% building /%} the recipes of the items you want them to create. The number of items the {% building /%} can learn are listed below:

| Building Level | Number of Recipes |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| 1              | 10                |
| 2              | 20                |
| 3              | 40                |
| 4              | 80                |
| 5              | 160               |

Additionally, upon reaching level 5, the {% building /%} learns the nine netherite recipes (shovel, hoe, pickaxe, axe, sword, helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots), which count toward the recipe total above.

When a colonist is requesting a tool from the {% building /%} with multiple accepted levels, the {% worker /%} will craft whichever tool type is highest in their list of recipes that they have the materials for (when you teach them a new recipe, it'll go on the bottom).

## Interface

{% building_gui_content_block_main order=1 /%}
{% building_gui_content_block_crafting_recipes order=2 /%}
{% building_gui_content_block_tasks order=3 /%}
{% building_gui_content_block_settings order=4 %}
- **Recipe Mode:** This is unlocked by researching {% research_link name="warehousemaster" /%} in the {% building name="university" /%}. This changes how multiple recipes for the same item are prioritized.
  - **Priority:** This is the default setting. The hut will try to use recipes that are higher up in their recipe list first.
  - **Warehouse Stock:** The hut will look in the warehouse first to see what resource you have more of before deciding what recipe it will use.
